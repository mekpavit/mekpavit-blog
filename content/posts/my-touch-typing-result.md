Since I can remember, I've never really cared about my typing. I've just typed the way I want to type! But last month, I've have a chance to actually improve my typing skill with touch-typing... And I'm very impressed with the result!


## Why I started bothering with how I type {#why-i-started-bothering-with-how-i-type}

It's all start from vim... One day, my friend cames convincing me to use vim as my main code editor.

I tried it and suddenly fell in love with vim. So, next day, to improve my modal editing skill (vim's style of editing), I got a book [Practical Vim: Edit Text at the Speed of Thought](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Vim-Thought-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/1934356980) hoping that it will guide me to vim's way!
And you know what? This is the very first page of the book says

> **Learn to Touch Type, Then Learn Vim**
>
> If you have to look down to find the keys on the keyboard, the benefits of
> learning Vim wonâ€™t come fast. Learning to touch type is imperative.

So, I guess you know now, how it get started.


## What I did for my last one and a half month {#what-i-did-for-my-last-one-and-a-half-month}

During my first two weeks, I focused on how to correctly type on QWERTY keyboard. I used <https://www.typingstudy.com/> as my main tool to learn where to place your fingers and which key should be typed by which finger.

Since I've never typed the correct way before, this was very hard. I just got confused by my old way of typing. For example, I'd used only left Shift for my whole life but touch-typing requires you to use both left and right Shift!!!

But after completed those 15 lessons, my fingers've started to get in place.

While I practicing in <https://www.typingstudy.com>, my average typing speed was around 20-30 wpm which is much slower than before I do touch-typing. So, after knowing all the correct finger placements, I needs to practice this skill.

Luckily, I have two non-human touch-typist at workplace, my colleague and my manager (their speed is like 90+ wpm). So they introduced me to my current touch-typing dojo which is where I've practiced my skill for a month, the great <https://www.typeracer.com>...

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/image_5.png" caption="Figure 3: Let's the fun begin! <https://www.typeracer.com> where touch-typing started to get fun" >}}

So, my last month was dedicated to the <https://www.typeracer.com> 30 games each days. To complete 30 games at typeracer, it took me around 30-40 minutes. That might sound a lot, but trust me, it was very fun! I've enjoyed the game so much and started to see the real result!


## And after 1,000 games at Typeracer, this is what I've got! {#and-after-1-000-games-at-typeracer-this-is-what-i-ve-got}

My typing speed went up from 30 wpm (after complete typingstudy) to ........... 70+ wpm!!! And thanks to Typeracer, this is my progress during the 1,000 games

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/image_6.png" caption="Figure 4: <https://www.typeracer.com> also keep track your improvement!" >}}

If any of you read til here and start convinced to practice touch-typing, I encourage you to try it! Next time, I will tell you my journey of modal-editing with VIM and Emacs!

_Special Thanks: Punpun for relentlessly convincing me to use Vim, Jo and Oue for introducing me Typeracer and always supporting me while I was going trough all the touch-typing pain LOL_
